# Urbindex App Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the PWA:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

These icons should be created with a cyberpunk/neon aesthetic to match the app's design.

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a dark background (#0a0a20)
- Include neon elements in blue (#05d9e8) and pink (#ff2a6d)
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Include the letter "U" or a map pin icon as the main element
- Make sure icons are properly sized for each dimension
- Save as PNG with transparency

## Additional Icons

The app also needs:
- map-icon.png (96x96) - For the map shortcut
- leaderboard-icon.png (96x96) - For the leaderboard shortcut
- badge-72x72.png - For notifications
