This is a placeholder for the default-avatar.png file.

To add your own default avatar:
1. Create a 128x128 pixel PNG image with a transparent background
2. Use the cyberpunk/neon aesthetic with colors from the CSS variables
3. Save it as "default-avatar.png" in this directory
4. Replace this text file with your PNG file

This image is used as the default profile picture for users who don't have a Google profile image.
