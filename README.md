YOU HAVE MANAGED TO FIND YOURSELF IN THE YOUNG AND STILL FORMING WORLD OF -URBINDEX-, MY VERY FIRST (AND FINALLY ALMOST FINISHED,, TOTALLY USABLE AS I AM TYPING THIS !!!) SOCIAL WEBSITE PROJECT. 
I CREATED THIS WEBSITE AS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE LOCALLY NEAR AND FAR WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO ENJOY A GOOD SNEAKING AROUND, ETC ETC, AND TO MAKE A MAIN HUB WHERE INFORMATION CONCERNING URBEX IN ONE'S
LOCALE COULD BE AMALGAMATED, GAZED UPON, LEARNED FROM, UTILIZED, AND KEPT FOREVER AND EVER.
